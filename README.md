Preprocessing the Data (https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)

1. Preprocessing the dataset prior to fitting the model.
2. Performing feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
3. Using MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
4. Separating the data into training and testing data.


For the purposes of this assighment I created two simple models - XGBoost and TensorFlow Keras two-layer model.
Both of them perform positively enough on the dataset (0.9896739130434783 for XGBoost and 0.989130437374115 for TensorFlow Keras).
My assumption is that such a great fit is possible due to the nature of the Kepler dataset and particular definition what is exoplanet.
